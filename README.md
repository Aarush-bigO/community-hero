## ✨ The Vision

Potholes. Broken streetlights. Water leaks. Overflowing dumpsters. They don't fix themselves — and the systems we have for reporting them are **fragmented, opaque, and frustrating**.

**Community Hero** turns every citizen into a sensor and every neighbourhood into a feedback loop. Snap a photo, drop a pin, and the AI does the rest. The community verifies. The dashboard shows progress. Heroes earn badges. Cities get smarter.

## 🎬 What Makes It Jaw-Dropping

This isn't a CRUD app dressed up. The frontend is a **living 3D world**:

- 🌐 **Animated 3D Globe** of all reported issues (Three.js + React Three Fiber)
- 🌌 **Particle starfield** background that reacts to scroll
- 💎 **Glassmorphism UI** with frosted panels, gradients, and motion
- 🪄 **Smooth scene transitions** powered by Framer Motion
- 🗺️ **Live Leaflet map** integration for hyperlocal precision
- 📊 **Animated impact dashboards** with Recharts
- 🏆 **Gamified leaderboard** with badge animations

## 🧠 AI Features

| Feature | How |
|---|---|
| **Auto-categorization** | LLM tags each report (pothole, streetlight, water, waste, infrastructure, other) |
| **Severity scoring** | AI rates urgency 1–5 from photo + description |
| **Duplicate detection** | Geo + semantic similarity prevents spam |
| **Predictive insights** | Hotspot forecasting from historical data |
| **Smart routing** | Suggests the right municipal department |

> Backend ships with a pluggable LLM service. Drop in OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, or run local with Ollama.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
┌────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│   React + Three.js │ ◄─────► │  Express API     │ ◄─────► │   SQLite DB  │
│   (frontend/)      │  REST   │  (backend/)      │         │  + uploads/  │
└────────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘         └──────────────┘
        │                              │
        ▼                              ▼
   Leaflet maps                   LLM service
   3D globe                       (OpenAI/Groq/Ollama)
```

Two clean apps in one repo. Frontend talks to backend over REST. Backend persists to SQLite (zero-config) and proxies AI calls.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aarush-bigO/community-hero.git
cd community-hero

# Backend
cd backend && npm install && cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in **both** `backend/` and `frontend/`:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

Add your LLM API key to `backend/.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR run fully local with Ollama — no key needed
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
```

### 3. Run
```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend on :4000
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend on :5173
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** and witness the 3D goodness. 🚀

## 📦 Deploy

### Frontend → Vercel
1. Import this repo on [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
3. Add env var: `VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url`
4. Deploy ✨

### Backend → Render
1. New Web Service on [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect this repo, set **Root Directory** to `backend`
3. Build: `npm install` · Start: `node src/server.js`
